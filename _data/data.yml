career-profile:
    title: Hire Me!
    summary: |
      I like to solve problems. Even as a child, I had an analytic way of thinking. Often I would annoy my family by changing the way we did things to be more efficient (they usually thanked me later). Now that I've found programming, I feel unstoppable. 

      What gets me excited are people-oriented problems. I strive to bridge the gap between ordinary people and extraordinary technology. I want to help people live easier and more fulfilling lives through technology without pain points and extreme learning curves. 

      I’ll be looking for new problems to solve starting in November 2019. If you’ve got a doozy you need a hand with, feel free to contact me directly at hayleyguillou at gmail dot com.
